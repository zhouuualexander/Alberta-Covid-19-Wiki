                <p>
                    
                    Due to Albertaâ€™s high case numbers, aggressive action is required now to protect our health system from being overwhelmed.
                    
                    The current situation is critical. These mandatory restrictions apply provincewide and will be in place at least until January 12, 2021.
                    
                    Health officials are monitoring the situation and will adjust measures if required.
                </p>
                <h2>Gathering restrictions</h2>
                <p>
                   
                    Alberta declared a State of Public Health Emergency to protect the health care system from COVID-19. Social gatherings are the top source of transmission.
                    
                    Effective Dec. 8, all indoor and outdoor social gatherings are prohibited. This will be enforced with $1,000 fines.
                </p>
                <h2>Workplaces, schools and child care</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Effective Dec. 8, masks are mandatory in all indoor public spaces and workplaces.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Effective Dec. 13, working from home is mandatory when physical presence is not required.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Current child care and K-12 learning measures remain in effect.

                  <h2>Why we need to isolate or quarantine</h2>
                <p>Isolating and quarantining help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by reducing the number of people you could infect if you're sick. Both require staying home and avoiding situations where the virus could spread.

                    COVID-19 can take up to 14 days to cause symptoms. Some people who get it only have minor symptom or don't have any symptoms at all but could still be infectious.
                    
                    By staying home, it lowers the chance of symptoms developing while you're in a public place, which lowers the chance of spreading the virus to others.</p>

              <p>
                To protect the health and safety of Albertans, public health orders are legally-enforceable and fines can be issued for violations.
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Minimum mandatory quarantine for 14 days for anyone who returned to or entered Alberta from outside Canada, or are a close contact of someone with COVID-19.</li>
                  <li>Minimum mandatory isolation for 10 days for anyone who has a confirmed case of COVID-19, or have core symptoms that are not related to a pre-existing illness or health condition: cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose or sore throat.</li>
                  <li>Operational protocols, including limited visitation, are enforceable for all auxiliary hospitals, nursing homes, designated supportive living and long-term care facilities, seniors lodges and any facility in which residential addiction treatment services are offered.</li>

              <h2>Outbreaks in Alberta</h2>
              <p>
                Locations of outbreaks in acute care and continuing care facilities are reported publicly when there are 2 or more cases, indicating that a transmission within the facility has occurred.

                Prisons, correctional facilities, shelters, child care settings, work camps, food processing/manufacturing facilities and public settings (restaurants, salons, gyms) are listed when there are 5 or more cases.
                
                Events and other workplaces (like office buildings) are listed when there are 10 or more cases.
                
                Outbreaks are declared over when 4 weeks have passed with no new cases, so not all outbreaks listed below have current transmission happening.
                
                As a precaution, outbreak control measures are put in place at continuing care facilities and group homes with a single confirmed case.

The changes include the expectation that operators develop a safe visiting policy and process in collaboration with residents and families. Other changes include:
